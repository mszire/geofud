    temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either
    as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval format. In the case of a
    Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset,
    the year 2011 would be written "2011/2012"). Other forms of content e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or
    TVEpisode may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL. Written works
    such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in
    ISO 8601 interval format format via "1939/1945".<br><br>Open-ended date ranges can be written with ".." in place of
    the end date. For example, "2015-11/.." indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final
    date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated. Supersedes
    datasetTimeInterval, temporal.<br>text Text The textual content of this CreativeWork.<br>thumbnailUrl URL A

    khảo.<br>Inverse property: translationOfWork.<br>Properties from Thing<br>additionalType URL An additional type for
    the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a
    relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native
    RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of
    extra types, in particular those defined externally.<br>alternateName Text An alias for the item.<br>description
    Text A description of the item.<br>disambiguatingDescription Text A sub property of description. A short

    image of the item. This can be a URL or a fully described ImageObject.<br>mainEntityOfPage CreativeWork or <br>URL

    Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website.<br>subjectOf CreativeWork or <br>Event A CreativeWork or Event
    about this Thing..<br>Inverse property: about.<br>url URL URL of the item.</p>
